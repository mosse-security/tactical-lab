2012-03-18 - Version 1.2.1.0 - Downloads: 1416

GENERAL
=======
* Needs AutoIt beta version 3.3.9.2 or later because of the new COM error handling
* Enhanced error checking in multiple functions
* Internal variables, parameter names and functions have been renamed to adhere more to the standards

SCRIPT BREAKING CHANGES
=======================
* _AD_ListDomainControllers: New parameter $bAD_ListGC. If set to True queries the DC for a Global Catalog. 
  Now disabled for performance reasons (Default is now False, was True before)

FIXED BUGS
==========
* Fixed some documentation bugs
* _AD_GetPasswordInfo: Doesn't return property "password last set" if the users UAC is set to "password never expires". Thanks for reporting to user Turkey77

NEW FUNCTIONS
=============

CHANGED FUNCTIONS
=================
* _AD_CreateUser: Escapes special characters in parameter $sAD_CN now. Enhanced error checking
* _AD_ErrorHandler: Now returns @AutoItVersion, @AutoItX64, @Compiled, @OSArch and @OSVersion for easier debugging
  Stripped down to only collect error data and write to the Console, a Msgbox or a file
* _AD_GetLastLoginDate: Parameter $aAD_DCList added. Allows to pass the list of DCs as returned by function _AD_ListDomainControllers.
  Enhances performance if the function is called many times
* _AD_GetObjectClass: Changed default for parameter $bAD_All from 0 to False (shouldn't make any difference for the user)
* _AD_GetUserGroups: Changed default for parameter $bAD_IncludePrimaryGroup from 0 to False (shouldn't make any difference for the user)
* _AD_GroupRemoveManager: Changed default for parameter $fAD_Flag from 0 to False (shouldn't make any difference for the user)
* _AD_ListDomainControllers: New parameter $bAD_ListGC. If set to True queries the DC for a Global Catalog. Disabled for performance reasons (default = False)
* _AD_Open: No longer sets @extended to 1 if a COM error handler could be established. A COM error handler is set up by _AD_ErrorNotify now
* _AD_SetGroupManagerCanModify: Set options to only update the DACL to solve this problem: http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;323749

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2011-12-19 - Version 1.2.0

FIXED BUGS
==========
* _AD_ErrorHandler (Internal function): A MsgBox could popup and stop a script running as a service. Was removed
* _AD_GetObjectAttribute: If a previously called function doesn't find an object (e.g. _AD_GetUserGroups returns no groups) then 
  _AD_GetObjectAttribute will not return the required attribute but set @error = 2. _AD_GetObjectAttribute might be called implicitely by another 
  function (e.g. _AD_DeleteObject to delete a user).
  Thanks to user FernandG for reporting this bug!
* _AD_FQDNToDisplayname: Strips off the first 3 characters of the displayname.
  Thanks to user thomy62 from the german forum for reporting this bug!

GENERAL
=======
* Setting the global variable $iAD_Debug writes debugging information to the console ($iAD_Debug=1), a MsgBox (=2) or a file (=3).
  When set to 3 you now can set variable $sAD_DebugFile to specify the location and name of the debug file. 
  Default: $sAD_DebugFile = @ScriptDir & "\AD_Debug.txt"

CHANGED FUNCTIONS
=================
* _AD_FQDNToDisplayname: Code rewritten. Now returns the error codes as set by function _AD_GetObjectAttribute
* _AD_GetPasswordExpired: Two new parameters have been added.
  $iAD_PasswordAge: All Users/computers with passwords older $iAD_PasswordAge days will be reported. 
    If not specified the maximum password age as returned by function _AD_GetPasswordInfo is used (default)
  $bAD_Computer: If set to True queries computer accounts, if False queries user accounts (default = False)  

MISCELLANEOUS
=============
* Some minor code changes
* Some minor documentation changes

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2011-09-17 - Version 1.1.0 - Downloads: 1404

FIXED BUGS
==========
* _AD_FQDNToDisplayname: Returned property "name" in previous versions. Now returns property "displayname" to match the function name
* _AD_FQDNToSamAccountName: Returned the "name" property. Was changed to return the "DisplayName" property
* _AD_GetLastADSIError: Didn't properly return the Win32 error code extracted from element[2]
* _AD_GetUserGroups: _AD_GetUserGroups(@UserName, 1) didn't return an array if the user is only a member of the primary group
  (e.g. 'Domain Users')
* _AD_RecursiveGetMemberOf: Didn't honor the $iAD_Depth parameter and therefore crashed when there was a loop in groups
* #include <Constants.au3> was not needed and removed
 
REMOVED FUNCTIONS
=================
* _AD_GetLastLDAPError: Never worked anyway
* _AD_GetGCAttributes: Replaced with _AD_GetSchemaAttributes

NEW FUNCTIONS
=============
* _AD_GetSchemaAttributes: Enumerates attributes of the AD Schema (those replicated to the Global Catalog, indexed attributes or all)
* _AD_VersionInfo: Displays an array of information about the UDF. Based on _IE_VersionInfo()

CHANGED FUNCTIONS

2011-06-07 - Version 1.0.0 - Downloads: 1395

GENERAL
=======
* Version number changed from 0.43 to 1.0.0. As the UDF has matured over time the first production version can be released
* The previous versions only allowed to query for objects in the domain you connect to using _AD_Open.
  When you connect to a domain controller which is a global catalog as well and you specify port 3268 then you are connected to the 
  Global Catalog and can query the whole forest
* Reworked the list of contributors. If I missed anyone please drop me a note
* I'm about to create some articles with extended information in the Wiki (still work in progress)

KNOWN BUGS: (last updated: 2011-08-14)
======================================
* _AD_RecursiveGetMemberOf: Doesn't honor the $iAD_Depth parameter. If you have a loop in your groups 
  (group A is member of group B is a member of group A) you will get error "Recursion level has been exceeded - 
  AutoIt will quit to prevent stack overflow.". A workaround is available. The bug will be fixed in the next version.
  Thanks to gcue for pointing me to this bug.
* _AD_GetUserGroups(@UserName, 1) returns no array if the user is only a member of the primary group (e.g. 'Domain Users'). 
  A workaround is available. The bug will be fixed in the next version.
  Thanks to supersonic for reporting the bug.
    
FIXED BUGS
==========
* _AD_EnablePasswordChange and _AD_DisablePasswordChange: User Suba noticed: The well known accounts SELF and EVERYONE are language dependant 
  and only worked on english systems. He provided the code to solve this problem - thanks!
* _AD_ListDomainControllers: Didn't connect to $sAD_HostServer to query the Configuration
* _AD_ListExchangeMailboxStores: Didn't connect to $sAD_HostServer to query the Configuration
* _AD_ListExchangeServers: Didn't connect to $sAD_HostServer to query the Configuration
* _AD_GetObjectProperties: Didn't set the # of columns in the returned array ($aAD_ObjectProperties[0][1] was empty)
* _AD_GetPasswordInfo: User Suba noticed: $sAD_HostServer was missing in the LDAP query
  
DOCUMENTATION CHANGES
=====================
* Some functions (_AD_GetAllOUs, _AD_ListDomainControllers, _AD_GetObjectsLocked, _AD_GetPasswordExpired, _AD_ListExchangeMailboxStores,
  _AD_GetManagedBy, _AD_GetManager, _AD_ListPrintQueues, _AD_GetAccountsExpired) returning a one-based two dimensional array had a wrong index 
  for the first element of each row. They started with 1 where 0 is correct
* Minor changes in multiple functions

NEW FUNCTIONS
=============
* _AD_GetGCAttributes: Enumerates all attributes that are replicated to the Global Catalog
  
CHANGED FUNCTIONS
=================
* _AD_DisablePasswordChange, _AD_EnablePasswordChange: The well known accounts SELF and EVERYONE now work for all languages
* _AD_FQDNToSamAccountName: If the parameter is already a SamAccountName then the function returns the parameter unchanged and without raising an error
* _AD_GetLastLoginDate: Now allows to specify a list of sites (separated by commas) to check the DCs
* _AD_GetObjectsDisabled, _AD_GetObjectsLocked, _AD_GetPasswordExpired, _AD_GetPasswordDontExpire, _AD_GetAccountsExpired:
  This functions now allow to specify a starting OU. So the functions won't search the whole domain
* _AD_GetPasswordInfo: Added password properties like DOMAIN_PASSWORD_COMPLEX etc.
* _AD_ListDomainControllers: The returned array now has a 6th element which is set to True when the Domain Controller is a Global Catalog as well.
  Connect to $sAD_HostServer to query the Configuration
* _AD_ListExchangeMailboxStores: Connect to $sAD_HostServer to query the Configuration
* _AD_ListExchangeServers: Connect to $sAD_HostServer to query the Configuration
* _AD_Open: You can connect to a specific DC in the current domain by just providing $sAD_HostServerParam (all other parameters remain blank)
* _AD_SamAccountNameToFQDN: If the parameter is already a FQDN then the function returns the parameter unchanged and without raising an error

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2011-03-01 - Version 0.43 - Downloads: 1214

GENERAL
=======
The $AD_Command object to execute LDAP queries has become a global variable. The default properties apply except for "Page Size" which is set to 1000
to allow an unlimited number of items to be returned by an LDAP query.
You now can set properties of this object using function _AD_SetADOProperties.
You can query properties of both the ADO command and the ADO connection object using function _AD_GetADOProperties.

KNOWN BUGS: (Last changed: 2011-03-30)
======================================
* User Suba noticed: The well known accounts SELF and EVERYONE used in functions _AD_EnablePasswordChange and _AD_DisablePasswordChange 
  only work on english systems. They are named different in other languages. A workaround is available if needed, otherwise this bug will be 
  solved in the next version.
* User Suba noticed: Under rare conditions function _AD_GetPasswordInfo can crash with "0x8007202B - A referral was returned from the server". 
  A workaround is available if needed, otherwise this will be solved in the next version.
  Update: Actually it's not a bug, it's a feature. But not handled very well by the UDF
    
FIXED BUGS
==========
* _AD_DeleteObject: Didn't work when the FQDN of the object didn't contain the string "OU="
* _AD_GetPasswordInfo: The Account Lockout Duration is correctly returned as 0. Was 15372286728.0913 because it was interpreted as a time value
* _AD_ListRootDSEAttributes (Example Script): Didn't work after changes made to the function in version 0.42
* _AD_RenameObject: Didn't work when the FQDN of the object didn't contain the string "OU="

CHANGED FUNCTIONS
=================
* _AD_FixSpecialChars: List of characters to escape/unescape extended. Is no longer an internal function and can be used by users
* _AD_IsObjectLocked: If the lockout duration is set to 0 (= the user has to be unlocked manually by an admin) then @error is set to -1
  (else it contains the number of minutes till the account gets unlocked)
* _AD_GetObjectsInOU: If parameter $fAD_Count=True then just the number of records returned by the query is returned (to improve performance)
* _AD_Open: A new flag can be passed as parameter so the function uses password encryption and/or a secure connection (SSL)

NEW FUNCTIONS
=============
* _AD_GetADOProperties: Retrieves all properties of an ADO object (Connection, Command)
* _AD_SetADOProperties: Sets properties of an ADO command object

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2010-12-19 - Version 0.42 - Downloads: 812

KNOWN BUGS: (Last changed: 2011-02-22)
======================================
* _AD_ListRootDSEAttributes (Example Script): Forgot to incorporate the script breaking change. Will be changed in the next version
* _AD_Open: If you specify a userid/password and get COM error "0x80020009 - The server is not operational" then please change line 159 to
    Global Const $ADS_USE_ENCRYPTION = 0x0
  _AD_Open uses ADSI flag ADS_USE_ENCRYPTION. ADS_USE_ENCRYPTION is the same as ADS_USE_SSL. They both have the value 2. 
  AD requires that the Certificate Server be installed to support SSL.
  I will have to decide if this security feature will be supported or removed from the next version
* _AD_DeleteObject and _AD_RenameObject: Don't work when the FQDN of the object doesn't contain an OU. Fixed versions can be found here
    
SCRIPT BREAKING CHANGES
=======================
* _AD_ListRootDSEAttributes: Multi valued attributes are no longer returned in a single string separated by "|" but as multiple lines in the array 

DOCUMENTATION CHANGES
=====================
* _AD_GetGroupMembers: Added remarks
* _AD_GetObjectsInOU: Documented how to use the escaping mechanism in the LDAP filter
* _AD_GetLastADSIError: Added remarks

CHANGED FUNCTIONS
=================
* _AD_GetObjectProperties: 1st parameter can now be an object so you can get the properties for a schema or configuration object as well
* _AD_ListDomainControllers: The function only lists writeable DCs (default). To query for RODC (read only DCs) you have to set flag $fAD_ListRO = TRUE.
  Now sets @error=1 if no domain controller is found
* _AD_ListRootDSEAttributes: Multi valued attributes are no longer returned in a single string separated by "|" but as multiple lines in the array
* _AD_Open: If you specify a userid/password the ADO property "Encrypt Password" ist set to true before sending the credentials

FIXED BUGS
==========
* Some functions only returned up to 1000 items due to using a M$ limit.
  Affected functions: _AD_GetAccountsExpired, _AD_GetManagedBy, _AD_GetManager, _AD_GetObjectsDisabled, _AD_GetObjectsLocked, _AD_GetPasswordDontExpire,
  _AD_GetPasswordExpired, _AD_GetUserPrimaryGroup. This functions have been be changed!
  Unlikely to be affected: _AD_ListExchangeMailboxStores and _AD_ListExchangeServers. This functions have not been changed.
* _AD_Open: Due to some bugs the bind cache wasn't used and a lot of unnecessary binds were created. This has put heavy load on the DC and sometimes
  lead to a COM error when all connections on the DC were exhausted

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2010-09-13 - Version 0.41 - Downloads: 1281

KNOWN BUGS: (last changed: 2010-12-18)
======================================
* The UDF doesn't use the bind cache at the moment. So a lot of unnecessary binds are done which puts heavy load on the domain controller. 
  In some cases the max. number of TCP connections is reached and the DC returns a COM error and rejects further connections until some of the 
  older connections have timed out. This bug has been solved as long as you don't provide userid/password when calling _AD_Open.
  Wait for version 0.42 (to be released in a few days) or insert after line 371:
    $oAD_RootDSE = ObjGet("LDAP://" & $sAD_HostServer & "/RootDSE") ; To guarantee a persistant binding
  The remaining bug when using credentials is under investigation!
* Some functions only return up to 1000 items due to using a M$ limit.
  Affected functions: _AD_GetAccountsExpired, _AD_GetManagedBy, _AD_GetManager, _AD_GetObjectsDisabled, _AD_GetObjectsLocked, 
  _AD_GetPasswordDontExpire, _AD_GetPasswordExpired, _AD_GetUserPrimaryGroup. This functions will be changed!
  Unlikely to be affected: _AD_ListExchangeMailboxStores and _AD_ListExchangeServers. This functions might be changed.

CHANGED FUNCTIONS
=================
* _AD_Open: No longer returns an array on error for Windows 7 and later.
  Return value is either 0 or 1
  @error is 1 to 8 (@extended set to error code received by the COM error handler (decimal))
  or the Win32 error code for Windows Vista and later (userid specified as Windows Login Name or User Principal Name).
  For the extended error information if @error > 8 you have to call function _AD_GetLastADSIError (please see _AD_Open example script)

FIXED BUGS
==========
* _AD_Open: If you used the Windows login name you got @error = 1317. Secure authentification flag was missing

NEW FUNCTIONS
=============
* _AD_GetLastADSIError: Uses the ADsGetLastError function to retrieve the calling thread's last-error code value. Is no longer an internal function

OTHER CHANGES
=============
* _AD_Open (Example Script): Enhanced for extended error information retrieval.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2010-09-07 - Version 0.40 - Downloads: 106

GENERAL
=======
* A big "THANK YOU" to feeks who spent a lot of time testing and proof reading the UDF!
* Biggest change in the UDF is the error checking done in _AD_Open. Be aware that on Windows 7 an array is returned in case of an error!
* Required version of AutoIt has been set to 3.6.6.0 as the newest version of date.au3 is required. But this UDF still has a bug (#1638)
  that has to be worked around

KNOWN BUGS: (last updated: 2010-09-10)
======================================
* I have a running discussion with supersonic (see the last post of this thread) about the return values of _AD_Open. 
  Maybe the way the additional error information on Windows 7 (as an array) is returned will change in a few days with a new version of the UDF.
* _AD_Open: If you use the Windows login name you get @error = 1317. As a workaround either use the NetBIOS Login Name (DOMAIN\user) or the 
  User Principal Name (user@domain.com) or change line 381 from
    Local $oAD_Temp = $oAD_OpenDS.OpenDSObject("LDAP://" & $sAD_HostServer, $sAD_UserId, $sAD_Password, $ADS_SERVER_BIND)
  to
    Local $oAD_Temp = $oAD_OpenDS.OpenDSObject("LDAP://" & $sAD_HostServer, $sAD_UserId, $sAD_Password, BitOR($ADS_SECURE_AUTH, $ADS_SERVER_BIND))  
  
CHANGED FUNCTIONS
=================
* _AD_GetObjectClass: With an additional parameter the function now returns all classes (main plus superior classes from which the main
  class is deduced hierarchically) in an array
* _AD_MoveObject: The third parameter (Common Name = CN) was calculated by searching for "OU=" in $sAD_Object. This didn't always work.
  Now the CN is retrieved using _AD_GetObjectAttribute.
* _AD_Open: Does extended authentication checking if you provide userid/password. On Windows XP or lower you get @error=8 if the userid or
  password is invalid. On Windows 7 or later _AD_Open returns an array with additional information. This and more errors will be handled:
	525 - user not found
	52e - invalid credentials
	530 - not permitted to logon at this time
	532 - password expired
	533 - account disabled
	701 - account expired
	773 - user must reset password
  The extended error checking of previous versions with ldapsearch has beend removed.
* _AD_UnlockObject: Unlocking an object using the UAC didn't work in all cases. Now uses property "IsAccountLocked"

FIXED BUGS
==========
* _AD_CreateMailbox: The check for @error=1 was missing
* _AD_GetGroupAdmins (Example Script): Only returned the admin for the first group
* _AD_HasFullRights, _AD_HasGroupUpdateRights, _AD_HasRequiredRights, _AD_HasUnlockResetRights now process a SamAccountName as parameter
  correctly as described in the docu
* _AD_MoveObject: If the second parameter $sAD_Object didn't contain the text "OU=" then the Common Name (CN) for the moved object wasn't 
  calculated correctly and the function returned a COM error. Now the CN is retrieved using _AD_GetObjectAttribute.

NEW FUNCTIONS
=============
* _AD_EnablePasswordExpire: Sets users password to expire
* _AD_IsAccountExpired: Returns 1 if the account (user, computer) has expired
* _AD_GetAccountsExpired: Returns an array with FQDNs of expired accounts (user, computer)
* _AD_ListSchemaVersions: Returns information about the AD Schema versions
* _AD_ObjectExistsInSchema: Returns 1 if exactly one object exists for the given property in the Active Directory Schema

NEW INTERNAL FUNCTIONS
======================
* _AD_GetLastADSIError: Uses the ADsGetLastError function to retrieve the calling thread's last-error code value

REMOVED FUNCTIONS
=================
* _AD_LockObject: Does not make sense. Never worked anyway

OTHER CHANGES
=============
* _AD_CreateComputer: Extended Remarks
* _AD_CreateMailbox: Extended description
* _AD_GetObjectsInOU (Example Script): Added examples to list accounts that do expire and accounts that already have expired
* _AD_SetAccountExpire: Extended description. This function always accepted date AND time
* A lot of text changes in the functions header (thanks to feeks for proof reading!)

* Most changes have been done with the handling of special characters and date processing (UTC vs. local time). Please test before using!

KNOWN BUGS: (last updated: 2010-08-24)
======================================
* _AD_MoveObject: If the second parameter $sAD_Object doesn't contain the text "OU=" then the Common Name (CN) for the moved object isn't 
  calculated correctly and the function returns a COM error. As workaround please provide the Common Name as parameter three.
* I noted some problems with "old" versions of the Date UDF (function _Date_Time_SystemTimeToDateTimeStr), so please use the most current 
  version of AutoIt. I'm testing with 3.3.6.0 at the moment
* The UDF does not support the "granular password policy" feature implemented with Windows Server 2008. 
  Invalid results for all password related functions might be returned. The subject is under investigation
* Keyword "Default": You can't use the keyword "Default" to omit parameters in a function call as the UDF does not support this keyword.

CHANGED FUNCTIONS
=================
* Handling of special characters (/, # and comma) has been improved in the following functions:
  _AD_DeleteObject, _AD_FQDNToDisplayname, _AD_FQDNToSamAccountName, _AD_MoveObject, _AD_RenameObject, _AD_SamAccountNameToFQDN
* _AD_FixSpecialChars (internal function): You can now specify which characters to escape/unescape
* _AD_GetObjectsLocked: Now returns a two-dimensional array. The lockout time and minutes until the object will be unlocked are returned as well
* _AD_GetPasswordExpired: Returns a two-dimensional array. The FQDN and the expiration time in UTC and local time are returned
* _AD_GetPasswordInfo: Returns password last changes and password expires now in UTC and local time
  Sets @error=4 when the maximum password age in the domain is set to 0 (= no password expires)
* _AD_Open: Sets @error=7 which means: Parameter $sAD_PasswordParam has to be specified when $sAD_UserIdParam is specified

FIXED BUGS
==========
* _AD_DisableObject: No longer toggles the flag, sets it now
* _AD_EnableObject: No longer toggles the flag, sets it now
* _AD_FQDNToDisplayName: All commas in the FQDN were escaped - which is wrong
* _AD_FQDNToSamAccountName: All commas in the FQDN were escaped - which is wrong
* _AD_GetPasswordExpired: Now works
* _AD_IsObjectLocked: Now honors the DST - because it doesn't use it anymore. All calculations are done with UTC
* _AD_IsPasswordExpired: Now works
* _AD_ModifyAttribute: Had wrong default value for $iAD_Option in syntax description (documentation bug)
* _AD_MoveObject: Had wrong parameter name in syntax description (documentation bug)

REMOVED FUNCTIONS
=================
* _AD_CopyObject: Is not available with the LDAP and WINNT provider. Never worked anyway

GENERAL
=======
If you call a function with a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) as parameter you as a user have to make sure that all special
characters (#, / and comma) are escaped with a preceding backslash. You can call the internal function _AD_FixSpecialChars(String,1) to escape
or _AD_FixSpecialChars(string, 0) to unescape the special characters.

KNOWN BUGS: (last updated: 2010-04-12)
======================================
* _AD_GetObjectsLocked(): Doesn't return a correct value when the lockouttime hasn't expired. The function has to be rewritten
* _AD_FQDNToSamAccountName and _AD_FQDNToDisplayName: Please remove the line
  $sAD_FQDN = _AD_FixSpecialChars($sAD_FQDN)
  from both functions. All commas in the FQDN are escaped which is wrong. Has been fixed in version 0.38.1
* _AD_IsObjectLocked: The function does not honor the DST and therefore might return a wrong result. Please insert after lines
    ; Get current bias for date calculation (including bias for DST)
    Local $aAD_Temp = _Date_Time_GetTimeZoneInformation()
    Local $iAD_CurrentBias = $aAD_Temp[1]
  this line
    If $aAD_Temp[0] = 2 Then $iAD_CurrentBias += $aAD_Temp[7]
  This should solve the problem. Will be fixed in version 0.39.

CHANGED FUNCTIONS
=================
* _AD_Close: Now sets a return code on success/error as all other functions already do
* _AD_FQDNToDisplayname: Special characters in the FQDN parameter are escaped
* _AD_FQDNToSamAccountName: Special characters in parameter $sAD_FQDN are escaped
* _AD_JoinDomain: If no credentials are passed then the credentials of _AD_Open are used if provided
* _AD_Open: Returns @error = 6 when $sAD_DNSDomainParam is specified but $sAD_HostServerParam and/or $sAD_ConfigurationParam is missing
  If you set the global variable $iAD_Debug > 0 then in case of error additional information will be displayed using ldapsearch. 
  Example:
  _AD_Open: Invalid ID-Data, Additional Information: 80090308: LdapErr: DSID-0C090334, comment: AcceptSecurityContext error, data 525, vece
  This tools has to be provided by you
* _AD_SetPassword: Flag $iAD_Expired has been added. If set to 1 the user has to change the password at next logon
* _AD_UnjoinDomain: If no credentials are passed then the credentials of _AD_Open are used if provided

FIXED BUGS
==========
* _AD_GetObjectsInOU: Doesn't return a result when the parameter $sAD_DataToRetrieve consists of a single value.
  $iAD_SearchScope now works for all values

KNOWN BUGS: (last updated: 2010-03-28)
======================================
* _AD_GetObjectsInOU: Returns an empty array when the parameter $sAD_DataToRetrieve consists of a single value.
  As a workaround please replace $aAD_DataToRetrieve with $sAD_DataToRetrieve in line 1129, 1130 and 1133
* _AD_GetObjectsLocked(): Doesn't return a correct value when the lockouttime hasn't expired. The function has to be rewritten
